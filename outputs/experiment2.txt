1. Machine Information: 
  - System: Linux 6.12.17-1-MANJARO 
  - Processor:  13th Gen Intel i3-1315U (8) @ 4.500GHz 
  - Python Version: 3.12.7 

2. Timing Mechanism: 
  - Using Python's time.perf_counter() for high-precision timing 
  - All times reported in seconds 

3. Experiment Repetition: 
  - Each sorting algorithm was run 3 times per input 
  - Warmup iterations per test case: 0 

4. Time Reporting: 
  - Average execution time across 3 iterations is reported 
  - Standard deviation is calculated to measure consistency 

5. Input Selection: 
  - Test data loaded from file: 'test_data.txt' 
  - Number of different test cases: 437 
  - Input sizes range from 50 to 2000 

6. Input Consistency: 
  - Same inputs were used for all sorting algorithms 
  - Each algorithm was tested on identical data for fair comparison
