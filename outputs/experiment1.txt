1. Machine Information:
   - System: Windows 11
   - Processor: Intel64 Family 6 Model 186 Stepping 2, GenuineIntel
   - Python Version: 3.13.0

2. Timing Mechanism:
   - Using Python's time.perf_counter() for high-precision timing
   - All times reported in seconds

3. Experiment Repetition:
   - Each sorting algorithm was run 3 times per input
   - Warmup iterations per test case: 0

4. Time Reporting:
   - Average execution time across 3 iterations is reported
   - Standard deviation is calculated to measure consistency

5. Input Selection:
   - Test data loaded from file: 'test_data.txt'
   - Number of different test cases: 437
   - Input sizes range from 50 to 2000

6. Input Consistency:
   - Same inputs were used for all sorting algorithms
   - Each algorithm was tested on identical data for fair comparison
